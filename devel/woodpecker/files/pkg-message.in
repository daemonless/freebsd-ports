Woodpecker Agent has been installed.

To use the 'local' backend (running steps directly on the host),
ensure you have installed the necessary tools (git, etc.) or plugins.

Recommended: Install the native git plugin:
  pkg install woodpecker-plugin-git

To use it in your pipeline:
  clone:
    git:
      image: local
      commands:
        - woodpecker-plugin-git

Note: The 'woodpecker-autoscaler' is not yet included in this port.
