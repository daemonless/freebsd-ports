Woodpecker CI is a simple, yet powerful CI/CD engine with great extensibility.
It is a community fork of Drone CI.

This package provides the Woodpecker server, which is the central component
that manages:

- Repository configuration and webhooks
- Build pipeline scheduling and orchestration
- Web UI for monitoring builds
- API for programmatic access
- Agent coordination and workload distribution

The server supports multiple database backends including SQLite (default),
PostgreSQL, and MySQL.
