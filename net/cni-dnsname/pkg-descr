dnsname is a CNI plugin that provides name resolution for containers
within a CNI network using dnsmasq. When enabled, containers on the
same network can resolve each other using their container names.

This plugin is primarily used by Podman to provide DNS resolution for
containers when using the CNI networking backend (e.g., on FreeBSD).
